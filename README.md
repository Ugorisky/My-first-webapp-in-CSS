# My-first-webapp-in-CSS
This is first web design where I learnt to integrate Basic HTML and CSS
Designed By me: Ugonna Sandiego Odirichukwu, at 11 years in my Primary 6.
My Instructor is my mum Dr. Mrs. Jacinta Chioma Odirichukwu

I am glad learning coding.

Have a feel of my beginners website, getting started with a smile.
